# MediaBender
This is a repository for the MediaBender, which uses Gestures for controlling media playback 

# Developer Guide
There are 2 folders, Hardware and App. They are pretty self explanatory. 
When working on your PBI, create a branch with this format:  
[ task-id ]-[ developer's name ] 
e.g.
sw1.1-etienne

Every commit should be meaningful (even when you really want to die). For example, these are not acceptable:

FUCK ME THIS DOESN'T WORK  
FUCK ME THIS WORK   
FUCK ME THIS WORKS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY   
kjflkjhsdhfajshdflakfsjdh   

Even if a dummy file was added, the commit message should be:  
_Added dummy file for < insert reason here >_

## Merging
When you are done with your feature. Be Sure unit tests ARE written (if applicable). Once they run and **PASS**, you can do a Pull request in GIT to master. You should state your task ID and a short description of what you've done (theoretically, github will autogenerate that).
